## 📦 Data Model

The app uses a secure schema where each user only sees their own data:

- `profiles`: User details like name and avatar.
- `courses`: Your courses with links and topics.
- `notes`: Your Q&A notes with code snippets and understanding levels (1 to 5).
- `daily_entries`: Your daily study logs with time and mood.

All tables use Row Level Security (RLS) to keep data safe.
