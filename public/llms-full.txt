## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **UI Library**: React 19
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS Variables for theming
- **Components**: shadcn/ui component library
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend/Data Layer
- **Primary Storage**: Browser localStorage (offline-first)
- **Cloud Storage**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for authenticated users
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with OAuth providers (GitHub, Google)
- **Data Migration**: Automatic localStorage to cloud migration on login

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Offline-First**: App works without internet. Cloud sync is optional.
2. **Privacy-Focused**: No tracking. Data stays local unless user opts for cloud.
3. **Responsive Design**: Full mobile, tablet, and desktop support.
4. **Dark Mode**: System-aware with manual toggle.
5. **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support.
